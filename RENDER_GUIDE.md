# 🚀 Render Deployment Guide (Free)

This is the easiest, completely free way to deploy.

## 1. Push Code
I have already configured everything. Just double-check everything is pushed (I will ask you to confirm this).

## 2. Go to Render
1.  Open [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com/).
2.  Login with **GitHub**.

## 3. Create Blueprint (Magic Button)
1.  Click **"New +"** (Top right).
2.  Select **"Blueprint Instance"**.
3.  Select your repository: **`kasparro-vivek-vardhan`**.
4.  Click **"Connect"**.

## 4. Finalize
1.  Render will read the `render.yaml` file I created.
2.  Click **"Apply"** or **"Create New Resources"**.
3.  Sit back! It will create the Database and the App automatically.

## 5. Get URL
- Once it finishes (green), click on the **Web Service** (`kasparro-backend`).
- Your URL is at the top (e.g., `https://kasparro-backend.onrender.com`).
